So, in this code, we create a SingleLinkedList class that supports linked list operations such as adding and removing nodes from both the front and back. Inside, we define a struct Node that stores the data as well as a pointer to the next node. Methods such as push_front and push_back add elements to the beginning and end of the list, accordingly. Insert allows you to add an element at a given index, whereas removal removes a node based on its position. Finally, we have a find function that searches over the list for the first occurrence of an item.

In main.cpp, 
Here's a simple stack implementation with a vector. We create a Stack class and store integers in it as a vector. The push function adds elements to the stack, whereas pop removes the top element. To examine the top element, we call the top function, which returns the vector's last item. If the stack is empty, a function named isEmpty returns true or false. Finally, findAverage determines the average value of the stack items by adding all of the values and dividing by the total number of elements.

finally, the output that we got,
